Eta is an embedded JS template engine, created by the team who made Squirrelly.

With Eta, you can write templates that are blazing fast and can be rendered in milliseconds, server-side or client-side.

Eta doesn't just limit you to HTML--you can use it with any language, and custom delimeters make it so there aren't parsing errors. It's also tiny (**~2 KB gzipped**), has **0 dependencies**, and is **blazing fast**.
